This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates a common off-by-one error. The program attempts to iterate over an array using a for loop, but the loop condition is incorrect, causing an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The solution demonstrates the correct way to iterate over an array to avoid this error.  This is a useful example for learning about array bounds checking in Java.
